        <h1 id="theHeading">My Biography</h1>
        <p>I am Ndaedzo Norbert Mufamadi born in Elim hospital in the Limpopo province. I grew up in Pretoria in the township called Soshanguve. This is where I spent most of my childhood and adulthood under the guidance of my parents.</p>
        <p>Growing up in a township has been a great teacher of life. Living in a small community, I learned the power of community unity. Growing in a working-class community, and the majority of the people depending on the government for services, I have always sought independence. To relieve myself from herd mentality and carve a new path that will lead to limited dependence on the government. Of course, I cannot do everything alone; that is why I have placed extra effort on learning teamwork and communication.</p>
        <p>I have always had an interest in gaining knowledge and exploring what are considered difficult concepts. Building my tolerance for challenges. I am motivated by my dream of participating in the development of software that can help in the development of Artificial Intelligence.</p>
